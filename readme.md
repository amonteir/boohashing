# BooHashing

Hello, cryptographers, developers, and spooky enthusiasts alike! Welcome to the haunted crypt of BooHashing. No, this isn't a Halloween joke, but a serious Rust CLI application that makes hashing as easy as getting scared in a haunted house! BooHashing uses your fears to its advantage, transforming any file into a cryptic hash digest.👻📜

## How It Works

BooHashing is a CLI app designed to take an input file and spookify it into a hash digest. We currently support SHA 256 and SHA 512 as our hashing algorithms, but don't worry, we're cooking up some more in our witch's cauldron.🧙‍♀️🔮

Input files? Bring 'em on! We don't shy away from any file type or size. The bigger, the scarier, the better!🎃📂

## Usage

The bones and skeleton of our command line arguments are as follows:

- `sha256` or `sha512`: These are the specters you invoke to choose your hashing algorithm. Spooky, isn't it?👻
- `-i <file_name>`: This is where you offer your sacrifice (input file) to the hashing spirits.🕯️📁
- `-f <file_name>`: The spirits, if properly invoked, will save the hash digest in the specified file in the `outputs/` crypt. If the spirits see no `-f` in their summoning circle, they will deliver the message directly to you in the console.🪦📜

## Future Plans

Currently, we only allow a single file as input, but in the future, we plan to conjure up support for multiple files. We also have plans to expand our library of hashing algorithms. Our team of developer wizards are tirelessly working in their coding dungeons to make this a reality.🧙‍♂️👩‍💻🧙‍♀️

## Disclaimer

While BooHashing has a fun and ghostly guise, it is a professional tool designed with a serious purpose in mind. We hope you enjoy using it as much as we enjoyed brewing it up!☠️💻
